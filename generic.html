								<p>I am Sathya Sudha Murugan pursuing M.Sc. in Data and Knowledge Engineering at Otto Von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.
									Currently I am doing Master Thesis on Combinatorial Optimization using Deep Reinforcement Learning at Trumpf located in Ditzingen, Germany.
									During my Final year of Bachelor’s in Computer Science Engineering, I gained theoretical knowledge about Artificial
									Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) through the seminar ‘Giraffe: The Chess
									Engine‘ which uses DRL to play chess. This seminar thrived my interest towards evolving existing and innovating
									new approaches through Machine Learning and ultimately lead into opting for this Master’s course, which helped
									me stack up profound knowledge in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Visual Analytics, NLP and
									Reinforcement Learning along with practical experience using Python and R languages. </p>
								<p>I gained practical knowledge on Feature Extraction Techniques, Interactive Visualizations using ggplot, plotly and
									ggiraffe packages, and applications of Visual Analytics through a project ‘visualization of dimension reduction
									results using scatter over contour plots’. Alongside, I leveraged my R language proficiency through deployment of
									an application using RShiny package. Kindly find the RShiny Application <a href="https://sathyasudhamurugan.shinyapps.io/VizDimReducShinyApp/">here</a>.</p>
								<p>Further, I learnt to work on extended Convolution Neural Networks using PyTorch Framework by working on a
									seminar ‘Brain tumor classification using CNN vs CV-CNN’. I also gained hands on experience over Graph Neural
									Networks through the project ERDOS as part of database scientific team project. As part of Deep Learning course, I
									learnt various Neural Network architecture such as MLP, CNN, RNN, Autoencoders over applications of Image
									Classification, NLP based Prediction and Translation, and Image Denoising. </p>
									I worked as a Student Research Assistant (Hiwi) at OVGU with the knowledge gained through courses and projects
								<p>in the university. During my First Hiwi, I extended my practical grip over Multi-Layer Perceptron by implementing a
									Regression Model using TensorFlow Framework to predict the HeatFlux of material after quenching. Then, In ILM Department, I
									I performed Gamification of Moodle and also worked on scheduling jobs of a simulation environment using LSTM
									and GRU. Due to the interest gained in problem statement, I started at AGWI Department as Hiwi dealing with the same
									problem statement using DRL. </p>
								<p>In AGWI department, I learnt the fundamentals of Deep Reinforcement Learning and exercised toy environments in my system’s GPU environment, and worked on optimization of scheduling jobs
									of a simulation environment using DRL through TensorFlow Framework. From Start of this Hiwi, I was fantasized by the game like environment being solved using DRL. This lead me
									towards opting for the internship at Trumpf on DRL for optimization of packaging problems. </p>
									At Trumpf I built a custom OpenAI gym environment to represent Markov Decision Process (MDP) performing Sequencing of parts. 
									Then trained Actor-Critic agent to produce sequence of parts to fit within  the canvas through reward maximization using 
									asynchronous Policy gradient optimization.</p>
								<p>Currently I am doing Mater Thesis on Combinatorial Optimization using Deep Reinforcement Learning on Ray framework at Trumpf. Here I am building custom gym environments to depict Operation Research problems such as Travelling Salesman Problem, Convex Hull and Knapsack. Also, Implemented Pointer Networks using LSTM and Transformer respectively as Actor. Currently training the Actor-Critic agent using A3C policy on Ray using Pytorch framework.
